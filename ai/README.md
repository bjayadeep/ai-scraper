# Multi-Domain Job Platform

One FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL database, company catalog, and scraper fleet classify each collected job against configurable profiles. Initial profiles are Cybersecurity (rolling 24 hours), Java Developer (current America/New_York day), and .NET Developer (current America/New_York day).

## Database migration

Run the Alembic migration before deploying the updated backend:

```bash
cd ai
alembic upgrade head
```

The FastAPI startup hook also runs `alembic upgrade head` automatically before serving requests, so existing Render services receive the migration during redeploy.

The initial revision creates the schema for empty databases, adds profile and observation tables to existing databases, seeds all three profiles, backfills `first_seen_at` and `last_seen_at`, and associates every existing job with Cybersecurity.

Scheduled runs (`main.py`) and manual company scrapes both use `src/ingestion.py`. Each company board is fetched once per run, jobs are upserted with source and observation timestamps, then classified against every enabled profile.

## Legacy overview

An automated daily job aggregator that scrapes careers boards of target companies, filters for US-based Cyber Security roles matching 1–6 years of experience, deduplicates against historical runs (last 90 days), applies a company diversity filter, formats a premium styled Excel sheet, and sends it via email.

## 🛠️ Features

1. **Dual Scrapers**:
   - Direct APIs for Greenhouse and Lever ATS boards (extremely fast, no browser load).
   - Playwright browser fallback for custom careers sites.
2. **Dynamic Filtering**:
   - Location checking (US/USA/Remote US).
   - Regex-based Cyber Security keyword checking.
   - Text parsing of experience requirements (limits to 1–6 years).
   - Optional validation using Google Gemini AI.
3. **Advanced Deduplication**:
   - Prevents duplicate job alerts by matching unique signatures (`company::title` & `apply_link`) from previous Excel runs stored in `data/history/` for the past 90 days.
4. **Company Diversity Filter**:
   - Ensures no company dominates the sheet by picking the **single best job** per company (ranking via scoring heuristics).
5. **Styled Excel Output**:
   - Table formats with Segoe UI, alternating rows, custom row heights, and active hyperlinks.
6. **Automation-ready**:
   - Fully automated daily triggers via GitHub Actions or local cron.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

### 1. Prerequisite Installation
Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
Fill in your SMTP and recipient details:
- **SMTP_HOST**: Server address (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail).
- **SMTP_PORT**: Standard TLS port `587`.
- **SMTP_USER**: Sender email address.
- **SMTP_PASSWORD**: App password (not your normal password; generate an App Password in Gmail Account Settings).
- **EMAIL_TO**: Recipient email address.
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: (Optional) For AI filtering. Set `USE_AI_FILTER=true` to enable.

### 3. Run the Aggregator
Run the main script to fetch jobs, filter them, generate the Excel sheet under `data/history/`, and send the email:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🦾 Automation with GitHub Actions

To automate this pipeline on GitHub:
1. Commit and push this codebase to a private repository.
2. In your GitHub repository: Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
3. Create the following Repository Secrets matching your `.env` settings:
   - `SMTP_HOST`
   - `SMTP_PORT`
   - `SMTP_USER`
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD`
   - `EMAIL_TO`
   - `EMAIL_FROM` (Optional)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Optional)
   - `USE_AI_FILTER` (Set to `true` if utilizing Gemini)
4. Go to the **Actions** tab in GitHub to run manually or wait for the automatic daily trigger at 5:00 PM UTC (10:30 PM IST).
5. The runner will commit the generated Excel report back into the repository under `data/history/` to maintain the 90-day history.
